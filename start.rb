# The first program to make sure everything is working

# We all start somewhere, so let's start with the basics of Ruby.

# The first thing we need to do is print something to the screen.

# puts is a method that prints something to the screen and then adds a new line.#Puts is short for "put string". the code below is a method and a string

puts "Hello World!"

# to run this program, type ruby start.rb in the terminal and hit enter. Make sure you are in the same directory as the file.

# fun fact: We can also print emojis to the screen to make our programs more fun.
puts "🫸🏻💥🫷🏻"

# We can also print numbers to the screen.

puts 1
puts 2
puts 3

# We can also print the result of an expression to the screen.

puts 1 + 1
puts 2 * 2
puts 3 / 3

# We can also print the result of a method to the screen.

puts "Hello World!".length
puts "Hello World!".reverse
puts "Hello World!".upcase

# we can also use numbers to modify strings

puts "Hello World! " * 2

# we can also use variables to store values

name = "Sunny"

# the code above is called a variable. A variable is a container that stores a value. In this case, the variable name stores the value "Sunny".

puts "Hello, my name is #{name}"

# the #{} is called string interpolation. It allows us to insert the value of a variable into a string.
